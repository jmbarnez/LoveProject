Place your sciâ€‘fi TTF font file in this folder and name it:

  sci-fi.ttf

Recommendations (free fonts you can try):
- Orbitron
- Exo 2
- Michroma
- Audiowide

Usage:
- The game will automatically attempt to load assets/fonts/sci-fi.ttf on startup.
- If the file is missing or invalid, it will gracefully fall back to the default font.
- You can change the path by updating Theme.fontPath in src/core/theme.lua.
