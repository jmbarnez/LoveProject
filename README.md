## Architecture Overview

The game uses a **hybrid Entity-Component-System (ECS)** pattern:

- **Entities**: Game objects (ships, projectiles, stations, etc.)
- **Components**: Data containers (position, health, renderable, etc.)
- **Systems**: Logic processors that operate on entities with specific components

### Key Systems

1. **Physics System**: Movement and velocity updates
2. **Collision System**: Entity-to-entity collisions and damage
3. **AI System**: Enemy ship behavior and decision making
4. **Rendering System**: Visual output and effects
5. **UI System**: User interface and interaction
6. **Content System**: Auto-discovery and loading of game content

## Development

### Adding New Content

1. Create content definition file in appropriate `content/` directory
2. Follow existing patterns for your content type
3. Content will be automatically loaded on game start

### Adding New Features

1. Create system file in `src/systems/`
2. Add update call in `src/game.lua`
3. Implement component interactions
4. Add UI integration if needed

### Debugging

- **Debug Panel**: Press F1 for debug information
- **Console Logging**: Use `Log` module for output
- **Entity Inspection**: Debug panel shows entity details
- **Performance**: Debug panel shows frame timing

## Content System

The game uses a file-based content system with automatic discovery:

- **Items**: Equipment, resources, modules
- **Ships**: Player and AI-controlled vessels
- **Turrets**: Weapon systems
- **Projectiles**: Ammunition types
- **World Objects**: Stations, asteroids, planets

Content is defined in Lua files and automatically loaded with validation and normalization.

## Multiplayer

Basic multiplayer support is included with:
- Player synchronization
- Event broadcasting
- Connection management
- State reconciliation

## Performance

The game includes several performance optimizations:
- Quadtree for spatial queries and collision detection
- Entity cleanup and memory management
- Icon caching for UI elements
- Distance-based rendering optimizations

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Add documentation for new features
3. Test changes thoroughly
4. Use the debug panel for development
